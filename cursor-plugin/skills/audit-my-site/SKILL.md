name: audit-my-site
description: Run a full Website Auditor audit — AI visibility plus SEO, security headers, broken links and performance in one report. Use when the user asks to audit their site, check its SEO, security or performance, or is preparing to launch or relaunch a site they own.
---

1. If the user has not named the website, ask which domain to audit.
2. Call `run_audit` for that domain.
3. Summarise the result by category — AI visibility, SEO, security headers,
   broken links and performance — then list the three fixes that would matter
   most, highest impact first.

If no API key is configured, call `get_sample_audit` instead so the user sees
exactly what the real audit returns, and tell them what it would take to run it
for real.
