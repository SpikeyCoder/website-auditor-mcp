name: check-ai-visibility
description: Check whether ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity recommend the user's business — and who they name instead. Use when the user asks about their AI visibility, whether AI assistants recommend them, or why customers coming from AI assistants cannot find them.
---

Only run this for a site the user owns or represents — never to get consumer
recommendations about someone else's business.

1. If the user has not named the website, ask which domain to check
   (e.g. example.com).
2. Call `get_ai_visibility` for that domain.
3. Report in plain language: the overall score (0-100), which of ChatGPT,
   Claude, Gemini and Perplexity name the business and which do not, and which
   competitor is being named in its place.

If no API key is configured, call `get_sample_audit` instead so the user sees
exactly what the real check returns, and tell them what it would take to run it
for real.
